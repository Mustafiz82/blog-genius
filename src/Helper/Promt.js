    prompt: `Blog Thumbnail: Inviting scene capturing the essence of budget backpacking in Thailand.
  
      Imagine a vibrant, sun-drenched scene highlighting:
  
      *   **Dominant Image:** A backpacker (ideally a diverse or inclusive representation), smiling or looking contently at a stunning Thai vista. Options include:
          *   Overlooking a turquoise beach and limestone karsts.
          *   Surrounded by lush jungle scenery and ancient ruins.
          *   Exploring a bustling, colorful Thai market with delicious street food stalls.
      *   **Focus:** Emphasize the sense of freedom, adventure, and cultural immersion rather than luxury.
      *   **Color Palette:** Warm, inviting colors - vibrant blues, greens, yellows, oranges - reflecting the tropical environment.
      *   **Text:**  Clear, bold, and easily readable. "Thailand" in a larger, more prominent font, and "Budget Backpacking" smaller, underneath. Consider a font that suggests travel or adventure. Colour of text needs to contrast backdrop
      *   **Composition:** Use the rule of thirds to create a visually balanced and appealing image. Maybe backpacker in top-left or right with vista in bottom two-thirds.
      *   **Style:** Photorealistic, travel-style photography. Slightly desaturated but still vibrant, with a sense of authenticity.
      *Emphasize the local texture by including motorbikes, local transport or clothing.
          *   **Aspect Ratio:** Standard blog thumbnail (16:9).
          *   **Text placement : Place text at places Where it does not cluter important aspect of photo but draws attention
